## Parallax Shader Overview
The Parallax Shader is designed to create a visually striking effect that simulates depth and detail on surfaces. This shader is especially useful for creating intricate and realistic textures on 3D models.

#### Tiling n offset
- X: Controls the horizontal tiling of the texture.
- Y: Controls the vertical tiling of the texture.
- Z: Adjusts the horizontal offset of the texture.
- W: Adjusts the vertical offset of the texture.

- AO (Ambient Occlusion): An image that defines how exposed each point on the surface is to ambient lighting.
- Height: Controls the height map, influencing the depth effect. Adjust the slider to set the height intensity.
- Iterations: Determines the number of iterations for the parallax effect. Higher values produce more detailed effects but may impact - performance.
- Normal Map: A texture that simulates small surface details.
- Color Texture: The base color texture of the material.
- Color Texture Multy: Multiplier for the color texture intensity. (Default: 1)
- Smoothness: Adjusts the smoothness of the material's surface. Higher values result in a shinier surface.
- Metallic: Defines how metallic the surface appears. Higher values result in a more metallic look.

## Tips
- Experiment with different AO, Height, and Normal Map textures to achieve unique effects.
- Balancing the Iterations value can help maintain performance while achieving the desired visual effect.
- Use higher resolution textures for better visual quality.

For the parallax shader, it has a custom node that can be connected to the UV of any texture, this effect depends on a loop so you
 can change that number in the script but increasing it will consume more power and will take more time to compile

## Marble Shader Overview
The Marble Shader is designed to create a realistic marble effect on surfaces in Unity. This shader enhances 3D models with intricate and visually appealing marble textures.

#### Tiling n offset
- X: Controls the horizontal tiling of the texture.
- Y: Controls the vertical tiling of the texture.
- Z: Adjusts the horizontal offset of the texture.
- W: Adjusts the vertical offset of the texture.

- Normal Map: A texture that simulates small surface details.
- Texture Color: The base color texture of the material.
- AO (Ambient Occlusion): An image that defines how exposed each point on the surface is to ambient lighting.
- Hue Fresnel Multy: Multiplier for the Fresnel effect on the hue.
- Hue: Adjusts the hue of the marble texture.
- Smoothness: Adjusts the smoothness of the material's surface. Higher values result in a shinier surface.
- Fresnel Power: Controls the power of the Fresnel effect, affecting how light interacts with the surface edges.
- Inner Smoothness: Adjusts the smoothness of the inner parts of the marble texture.
- Reflection Overlay: Controls the intensity of the reflection overlay on the surface.
- Reflection Brightness: Adjusts the brightness of reflections on the material.

## Tips
- Experiment with different Normal Map and Texture Color options to achieve unique marble effects.
- Adjust the Hue and Hue Fresnel Multy to customize the color and intensity of the marble texture.
- Use the Smoothness and Inner Smoothness sliders to fine-tune the surface appearance for a more realistic look.

I have a tutorial video that goes through multiple looks for the marble shader (double reflection):
