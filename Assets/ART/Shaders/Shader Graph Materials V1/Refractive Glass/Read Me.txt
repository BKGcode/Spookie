## Overview
The Refractive Shader is designed to simulate the refraction using either the nearest reflection probe or a cube map which can be created by backing a reflection probe (HDRP has to use the cube map method). This shader can be used to create realistic glass, water, or any other refractive surface.

### Surface Inputs
#### Texture
- Texture: Assign the main texture of the material here.

#### Surface Color
- Surface Color: Base color of the material.
- Specular: Controls the specular reflection color.
- Smoothness: Determines how smooth or rough the surface appears. Higher values result in a shinier, more reflective surface.
- Normal: Assign a normal map to add detailed surface texture and definition and affect refraction.

#### Additional Parameters
- Normal Strength: Adjusts the intensity of the normal map. A value of 1 means full strength, while 0 means no effect.
- Emission: Defines the color and intensity of light emitted by the material.
- Refraction Tint: Tints the color of the refracted light.
- IOR (Index of Refraction): Controls the bending of light through the material. Adjust to simulate different materials.
- Refraction Blur: Adds a blur effect to the refracted light, simulating imperfections in the material.

#### Tiling and Offset
- Tiling: Adjusts the scale of the texture. Use X and Y values to stretch or shrink the texture.
- Offset: Moves the texture along the X and Y axes.

- Refraction Cube: Assign a cubemap to be used.
- Use Cube: Enable this checkbox to use the assigned Refraction Cube instead of reflection probe (HDRP only works with this option).


## Tips
- Experiment with different IOR values to achieve the desired refractive effect.
- Use high-quality normal maps to enhance the surface detail.
- Combine refraction and reflection properties to create realistic glass-like materials.
- Use the lit version if you want your object to interact with lights.

By following these instructions, you can effectively utilize the Refractive Shader to create stunning, realistic materials for your projects.
