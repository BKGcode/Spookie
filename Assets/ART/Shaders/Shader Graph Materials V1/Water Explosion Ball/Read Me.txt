## Overview
The Water Ball Shader is designed to create a dynamic, watery effect on a material in Unity. This shader simulates the appearance of a water-filled ball with animated distortions and colorful highlights, ideal for enhancing the visual appeal of water-related objects in your project.

### Surface Inputs
#### Distortion
- Distortion Speed Y: Controls the vertical speed of the distortion effect. Adjust to change the flow rate of the water pattern.
- Distortion Speed X: Controls the horizontal speed of the distortion effect. Adjust to change the flow rate of the water pattern.
- Distortion Size: Adjusts the scale of the distortion effect. Larger values create bigger, more noticeable waves.
- Distortion: Controls the overall intensity of the distortion effect. Higher values result in more pronounced distortions.

#### Emission
- Emission: Sets the color of the light emitted by the material. Useful for creating a glowing effect.
- Emit Multy: Multiplier for the emission intensity. Higher values increase the brightness of the emitted light.

- Alpha: Adjusts the transparency of the material. Higher values make the material more opaque.
- Texture: Assign the main texture for the water pattern.
- Tiling X/Y: Adjusts the scale of the texture on the X and Y axes. Higher values repeat the texture more frequently.

### Additional Parameters
- Smoothness: Determines how smooth or rough the surface appears. Higher values result in a shinier, more reflective surface.
- Metallic: Adjusts the metallic appearance of the material. Higher values make the material look more like metal.
- Explo Color: Sets the color of the explosion effect within the water ball.
- Explo Power: Controls the intensity of the explosion effect.
- Explo Contrast: Adjusts the contrast of the explosion effect.
- Explosion: Controls the size of the explosion effect. Larger values create bigger explosions.
- Outer Color: Sets the color of the outer edge of the water ball.

## Tips
- Distortion Settings: Experiment with different Distortion Speed and Size values to achieve various water movement patterns.
- Emission Color: Use bright and contrasting emission colors to make the water ball stand out, especially in darker environments.
- Tiling Adjustments: Fine-tune the tiling settings to match the scale of the water texture to your object, avoiding overly repetitive patterns.
- Explosion Effect: Use the Explo Power and Explo Contrast settings to create dynamic and visually appealing explosion effects inside the water ball.
