## Overview
The Wind Shader is designed to simulate the effect of wind blowing across a material in Unity. This shader can create a realistic waving or fluttering motion, making it ideal for materials like fabric or other objects that need to respond dynamically to wind.

### Surface Inputs
#### Texture
- Texture Color: Assign the base texture of the material. This texture defines the primary color and pattern of the material.
- Normal Map: Assign a normal map to add detailed surface texture and definition.

### Wind Properties
- Normal Strength: Adjusts the intensity of the normal map. A value of 1 means full strength, while 0 means no effect.
- Smoothness: Determines how smooth or rough the surface appears. Higher values result in a shinier, more reflective surface.
- Metallic: Adjusts the metallic appearance of the material. Higher values make the material look more like metal.
- Wind Speed: Controls the speed of the wind effect. Higher values make the material move faster, simulating stronger wind.
- Wind Noise Scale: Adjusts the scale of the noise pattern used to simulate wind. Higher values create larger, more noticeable wind patterns.
- Wind Power: Controls the intensity of the wind effect. Higher values result in more pronounced movements.

### Additional Parameters
- Normal or Absolute?: Determines whether the wind direction is relative (normal) or absolute.
- Absolute Vector: Defines the direction of the wind when "Normal or Absolute?" is set to absolute. The vector components (X, Y, Z) control the wind direction on each axis.

## Tips
- Wind Settings: Experiment with different Wind Speed and Wind Power values to achieve the desired wind effect. 
- Normal Map: Use high-quality normal maps to enhance the surface detail and realism of the material's response to wind.
- Noise Scale: Adjust the Wind Noise Scale to create varied wind patterns, from gentle breezes to turbulent gusts.
- Smoothness and Metallic: Fine-tune these settings to match the visual style of your material, ensuring it reflects light and appears as intended under different lighting conditions.



This effect is applied on the whole mesh ... there are several ways to limit it to parts of the mesh:
1- having a texture that defines in white the areas that have full effect and to the black less and less until no effect
2- limit based on the uv which works if the mesh is unwraped as one piece
3- based on the position of the vertices

I have a video tutorial on some of these methods:
