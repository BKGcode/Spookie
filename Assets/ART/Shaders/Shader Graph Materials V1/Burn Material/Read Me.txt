## Overview
The Burn Shader is designed to create a burnt or charred effect on a material in Unity. This shader 
can simulate the appearance of an object that has been partially burned, showing different textures 
and colors for the burned and unburned areas.

### Surface Inputs
#### Texture
- Texture Tint: Tints the main texture of the material.
- Texture: Assign the main texture of the material here.

#### Normal
- Normal: Assign a normal map to add detailed surface texture and definition.
- Normal Power: Adjusts the intensity of the normal map. A value of 1 means full strength, while 0 
  means no effect.
- Tiling n Offset: Adjusts the scale (X, Y) and position (Z, W) of the normal map texture.

#### Burn Properties
- Burn Tint: Tints the burned areas of the material.
- Burn Texture: Assign a texture for the burned areas.
- Burn Normal: Assign a normal map for the burned areas.
- Burn Normal Power: Adjusts the intensity of the burn normal map.
- Burn Tiling n Offset: Adjusts the scale (X, Y) and position (Z, W) of the burn texture.

#### Additional Parameters
- Lerp: Controls the interpolation between the burned and unburned areas.
- Only Black Areas: When enabled, only show unburned texture.
- Noise Scale: Adjusts the scale of the noise pattern that determines the burned areas.
- With Edge: When enabled, adds an edge effect to the burned areas.
- Edge Thickness: Controls the thickness of the edge effect around the burned areas.
- Edge Color: Defines the color of the edge effect.
- Smoothness: Determines how smooth or rough the surface appears. Higher values result in a shinier, 
  more reflective surface.

## Tips
- Experiment with different Noise Scale values to achieve varied burned patterns.
- Use high-quality normal maps to enhance the surface detail.
- Adjust the Lerp and Edge Thickness values to fine-tune the transition between burned and unburned areas.

By following these instructions, you can effectively utilize the Burn Shader in Unity to create 
stunning, realistic materials for your projects.
