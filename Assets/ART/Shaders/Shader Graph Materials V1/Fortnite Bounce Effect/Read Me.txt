## Overview
The Fortnight Effect Shader is designed to create a dynamic bending effect on a material in Unity. This shader can simulate the appearance of an object being bent when hit, adding a unique visual distortion to the surface.

### Surface Inputs
- Speed: Controls the speed of the bending effect. Higher values increase the animation speed.
- Area of Bending: Adjusts the size of the area affected by the bending effect.
- Stretch Distance: Controls the distance over which the bending effect stretches.
- Pointeness: Adjusts the sharpness of the bending effect.
- Texture: Assign the main texture of the material here.
- Point of Bend: Sets the origin point of the bending effect. Look at the ClickToBounce.cs script for an example.
- Direction: Defines the direction of the bending effect. Use X, Y, and Z values to set the direction.

## Tips
- Experiment with different Speed values to find the optimal animation speed for your effect.
- Adjust the Area of Bending and Stretch Distance values to achieve the desired level of distortion.
- Use the Point of Bend and Direction values to customize the origin and direction of the bending effect.

Enter play mode and click on the wooden wall to have the effect of bounce

The effect needs a collider and the ClickToBounce script on any object as well as the material
