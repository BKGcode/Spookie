Toon Shader uses the main light to create toon shading like cartoon.

### Surface Inputs
- Texture Color: The base color texture of the material.
- Light Intensity: Changes how bright the surface is.
- Shadow Edge: Defines where the shadow starts.
- Shadow Tint: Defines the tint/darkness to apply.
- Shadow Smoothness: Defines how smooth the transition between edges.
- AO: (Ambient Occlusion in Built In Lit) changes how much default shadows are in effect.

Notes:
- There are two Shaders one for URP/HDRP and one for Built In renderer
- The Unlit variant of Built In and HDRP doesn't support shadows but looks more like regular toon shaders.
- The Lit variant of Built In and HDRP supports default shadows and has a hack way to negate the objects own shadow and only this one supports additional lights. 
- The URP Unlit looks good and supports shadows

Try to keep the second edge below the first one to have a correct look
