## Overview
The Water Fountain Shader is designed to create a realistic, flowing water effect on a material in Unity. This shader simulates the appearance of water in motion, making it ideal for objects like fountains, waterfalls, or other water-related features.

### Surface Inputs
- Albedo: Assign the main texture for the water surface. This texture will define the primary color and pattern of the water.
- Alpha: Adjusts the transparency of the material.

#### Cutout
- Cutout Start: Defines the starting point for the cutout effect. Adjust to control where the water starts becoming visible.
- Cutout Speed: Controls the speed of the cutout effect. Higher values make the cutout effect progress faster.

#### Tiling & Offset
- Tiling X/Y: Adjusts the scale of the texture on the X and Y axes. Higher values repeat the texture more frequently.
- Offset Z/W: Adjusts the position of the texture on the Z and W axes. Useful for animating the texture or fine-tuning its placement.

#### Noise
- Noise Scale: Adjusts the scale of the noise pattern used to distort the water texture. Higher values create larger, more noticeable distortions.
- Texture Speed: Controls the speed at which the texture moves, simulating flowing water.

#### Distortion
- Distortion: Controls the overall intensity of the distortion effect. Higher values result in more pronounced distortions.
- Distortion Speed: Adjusts the speed of the distortion effect. Higher values make the water appear to flow faster.
- Distortion Size: Adjusts the scale of the distortion effect. Larger values create bigger, more noticeable waves.

- Cutout X Tiling: Adjusts the scale of the cutout effect on the X axis. Higher values repeat the cutout pattern more frequently.

#### Normal
- Normal: Assign a normal map to add detailed surface texture and definition to the water.
- Normal Power: Adjusts the intensity of the normal map. A value of 1 means full strength, while 0 means no effect.

- Smoothness: Determines how smooth or rough the surface appears. Higher values result in a shinier, more reflective surface.

## Tips
- Distortion Settings: Experiment with different Distortion Speed and Size values to achieve various water movement patterns.
- Noise Scale: Use varying Noise Scale values to create different types of water distortions, from gentle ripples to turbulent flows.
- Cutout Effect: Adjust the Cutout Start and Cutout Speed to control how the water appears and disappears, useful for simulating effects like rising water levels.
- Normal Map: Utilize high-quality normal maps to enhance the surface detail and realism of the water.



Make sure to have the mesh unwraped such that it occupy the whole texture if the texture is seamless
